"""Merge Sort Algorithm:

    - It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
    - It divides the input array into two halves.
    - Continues dividing the array until each sub-array has only one element.
    - Merges the sub-arrays with single items to produce new sorted arrays.
    - Repeats the process until there is only one sorted array remaining.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
