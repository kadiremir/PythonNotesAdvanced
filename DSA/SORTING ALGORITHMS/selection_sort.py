"""Selection Sort Algorithm:

    - Selection sort repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and places it at the beginning.
    - It continues this process until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity: Best, Average, and Worst-case: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place algorithm)
