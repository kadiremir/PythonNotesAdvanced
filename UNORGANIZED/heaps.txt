HEAP:

    Heap is an ordered tree.
        i.e. the parent node is greater (or lower) than or equal to the child node.

    There are two types of heaps:
        1. Max Heap: In a max heap, the parent node is greater than or equal to the child node.
        2. Min Heap: In a min heap, the parent node is less than or equal to the child node.

    A heap is a complete binary tree.
    Heaps are used to implement priority queues.

    Operations:
        1. Insert/Delete
        2. Heapify
        3. Build Heap

    Heapify:
        Heapify is the process of converting a binary tree into a heap.

    Build Heap:
        Build heap is the process of converting an array into a heap


    Time Complexity:
        Insert: O(log n)
        Delete: O(log n)
        Heapify: O(log n)
        Build Heap: O(n)

    Usage:

        1. Heap Sort
            It is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
                It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end.
                We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
                Complexity: O(n log n)
        2. Priority Queue
            A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in a queue and returns them based on their priority.
