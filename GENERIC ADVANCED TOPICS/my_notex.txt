Module: In Python, module can refer to a single file, single function or method

Function vs Method: Function can be considered as a standalone entity, whereas method is a function that belongs to a class.

Example of a function:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Example of a method:
class Math:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

Encapsulation: means hiding the details of how something works and only showing what is necessary.
In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using private variables and methods.

A "member" in a Python class refers to any attribute or method that belongs to the class.
